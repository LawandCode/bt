"""
The Reactor synchronously dispatches service requests received concurrently
from multiple resources to event handlers.  The Reactor is a singleton
object which runs an event loop which blocks until one of the resources it is
monitoring is ready to be serviced.  It monitors file objects (including
sockets).  Event handlers register with the Reactor to be notified on read
and/or write events for a particular resource.  When no longer interested,
they may unregister the resource.  Event handlers may also register a timer to
be notified after an interval of time has passed.

A handler registering to receive read events must implement a read_event()
method on which to be called when a read event occurs and a stream() method
which returns a reference to the resource to be monitored.  Similarly, a
handler for write events must implement a write_event() and a stream() method.
A handler registering to receive a timer notification must implement a
timer_event() method.
